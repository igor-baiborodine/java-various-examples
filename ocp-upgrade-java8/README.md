-----------------

####Exam topics:

#####1. Lambda Expressions
1.1 Describe Java inner classes and develop the code that uses Java inner classes (such as: nested class, static class, local class and anonymous classes)
* Define and write functional interfaces
* Describe a Lambda expression; refactor the code that use anonymous inner class to use Lambda expression; including type inference,target typing

#####Using Built in Lambda Types
* Describe the built in interfaces included in Java 8 – java.util.function package
* Develop code that uses Function interface
* Develop code that uses Consumer interface
* Develop code that uses Supplier interface
* Develop code that uses UnaryOperator interface
* Develop code that uses Predicate interface
* Develop the code that use primitive and binary variations of base interfaces of java.util.function package
* Develop the code that use method reference; including refactor the code that use Lambda expression to use method references

#####Filtering Collections with Lambdas
* Develop the code that iterates a collection by using forEach; including method chaining
* Describe the Stream interface and pipelines
* Filter a collection using lambda expressions
* Identify lambda operations that are lazy

#####Collection Operations with Lambda
* Develop the code to extract data from an object using map
* Search for data using search methods including: findFirst, findAny, anyMatch, allMatch, noneMatch.
* Describe the unique characteristics of the Optional classes
* Perform calculations using methods: count, max, min, average, sum
* Sort a collection using lambda expressions
* Save results to a collection by using the collect method and Collector class; including methods such as averagingDouble,groupingBy,joining,partitioningBy

#####Parallel Streams
* Develop the code that use parallel streams
* Implement decomposition, reduction, in streams

#####Lambda Cookbook
* Develop the code that use Java SE 8 collection improvements: Colleciton.removeIf, List.replaceAll, Map.computeIfAbsent/Present, Map.forEach
* Read files using lambda improvements: Files.find, lines(), walk()
* Use merge, flatMap methods on a collection
* Describe other stream sources: Arrays.stream(), IntStream.range()

#####Method Enhancements
* Adding static methods to interfaces
* Define and use a default method of a interface; Describe the inheritance rules for a default method

#####Use Java SE 8 Date/Time API - 10%
* Create and manage date-based and time-based events; including combination of date and time into a single object using  LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, Instant, Period, Duration
* Work with dates and times across time-zones and manage changes resulting from daylight savings
* Define and create timestamps, periods and durations; apply formatting to local and zoned dates and times

#####JavaScript on Java with Nashorn
* Develop Javascript code that creates and uses Java members such as Java objects, methods, JavaBeans, Arrays, Collections, Interfaces.
* Develop code that  Evaluates JavaScript in java, Passes Java object to Javascript, invokes Javascript function and call methods on javascript objects.
